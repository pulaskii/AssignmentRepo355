------------------ Project Summary ------------------
A medical records sharing platform, supporting both emergency sharing and recipient specified sharing.  

The program has a web front end, with different portals for doctors and patients.  Patients are able to fill in and create medical fields or upload a pdf, which then fills in for a sql table on a database.  Patients are also able to search for and share documents with doctors that have public accounts on the site, and patients have the ability to create emergency keys, in the form of qr codes, to enable doctors to access their records without sharing access. 

The web app contains an AI tool which helps provide a quick summary of a patientâ€™s medical history for doctors who need quick access to specific information.

Doctors have the ability to edit records which are shared with them, and can access new records using an emergency key.  

Both types of accounts can set their privacy status to public or private, to enable or disable new accounts from sharing/accessing documents with them.  Accounts are created using an email, which is sent a verification email, and can be deleted.
